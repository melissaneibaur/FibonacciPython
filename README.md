# FibonacciPython

Client server implementation to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.

This is my first attempt at Python and I had a lot of fun with it.
Ideally there would be some extra exception handling on the server and client as well as more testing.

This program was created using Python 3.5.0a2

# Usage Instructions
Run the server

> ./runserver.sh &

Run the client with server running

> python3 socketClient.py <arg>

Run the test script with server running

> ./test.sh
